# BlogApp
Mini-Project: Personal Blog Platform

Objective: Create a simple personal blog platform where users can read posts, and the admin can add or delete posts.

Frontend:
Design a homepage that lists all blog posts with titles and short descriptions.
Create a detailed view page for when a user clicks on a blog post title.
Implement a simple admin page with forms for adding new blog posts and deleting existing ones. Use HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript for form validation.

Backend:
Set up a basic web server using a Python framework like Flask or Django.
Implement backend routes for serving the homepage, post detail view, and admin actions (CRUD operations).
Use template rendering to pass data from the backend to the frontend.

Database:
Design a simple SQL database schema for blog posts with fields for the title, content, and publication date.
Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the database in Python for CRUD operations.

Version Control:
Initialise a Git repository for the project.
Make regular commits to demonstrate the understanding of version control workflow.
Problem Solving and Debugging:
Include at least one intentional bug in the frontend and one in the backend that requires debugging.

Instructions:
Start by initializing a Git repository for your project and commit your changes regularly.
Set up a Python virtual environment and install Flask or Django.
Build your SQL database and connect it to your Python application using an ORM.
Develop the backend routes and implement CRUD operations for blog posts.
Create frontend pages (homepage, post detail view, and admin page) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Write backend code to render the frontend templates with data from your database.
Implement form validation using JavaScript on the admin page.
Ensure that you handle any potential exceptions that may occur during database operations.
Fix the intentional bugs as part of your debugging process.
The candidate should provide their Git repository URL for cloned local work, including commit history which demonstrates version control understanding, and a live demo if possible, mirrored by a README file explaining how to set up and run the project.

Evaluation:The mini-project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
Code quality and structure.
Proper use of Git, including commit messages and history.
Functionality of the CRUD operations.
Design of the frontend and responsive layouts.
Implementation of JavaScript form validation.
Successful interaction with the database using an ORM.
Handling of exceptions and overall stability of the application.
Effective debugging of the introduced bugs.
